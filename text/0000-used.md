# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Add a `used` attribute to prevent symbols from being discarded.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

The compiler cannot always see all references to a symbol. For example, if a
symbol is only referenced from inline assembly, the compiler might think that
the symbol is unused.

If the compiler thinks that a symbol is unused, it might optimize the symbol
away which might change the behavior of the program or cause the linking step to
fail. For example:

```rust
#![allow(dead_code)]

#[link_section = ".init_array"]
static F: extern fn() = f;

extern fn f() {
    println!("test");
}

fn main() { }
```

When this program is compiled without optimization, it prints "test". But if it
is compiled with optimization, it prints nothing.

# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

A `#[used]` attribute is added. This attribute can be applied to static
variables and functions without type parameters.

If an items is marked with this attribute, the compiler generates the
corresponding symbol and the symbol is not discarded by the compilation or
linking process.
